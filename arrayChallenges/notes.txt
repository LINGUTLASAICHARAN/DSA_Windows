sub array = continuous of an array
number of sub arrys in a array of size n is nC2 + n  = n(n+1)/2
nC2 choosing a starting point and an ending point  + al solo elements


subsequence = sequence got by picking elements with out changing order
no of subsequences = (2 ^ n) -1  (n is the size of array)
Every Subarray is a Subsequence but every Subsequence is not a Subarray .
